Disclaimer: this is only meant to be a quick simple project for the [StackUp July Coding Challenge](https://hackathon.stackup.dev/web/events/49)

### What is this about?
This is the webpage that launches when you open a new Chrome-based tab using the code in the [main stackie os repo](https://github.com/KeaneTries/stackup-os-webpage). It is meant to be a throwback to one of the stackup bounty way back in 2023. It's so old that you can not even access that [old bounty's link](https://app.stackup.dev/bounty/planner-app-%E2%80%93-your-custom-widget) anymore! Ah how time flies.

### Features
Porting over from the old bounty, here are the existing features:  
* Timer
* Clock
* Calendar
* Todo list

### Why chrome extension?
There was a point of time that I do feel my life revolves around stackup. Every week I will be looking out for that timer to go off and I can rush to complete the quest. During those time, sometimes I wished that there could be a better way to remind me of the quests, apart from keeping eyes peeled on the website or the discord server. So after seeing the buildspace os implementation, I think this is the exact thing I would have wanted back then, and it's so simple to implement.

### Future plans
I do plan to keep adding a few more things to this page, so if you keep this installed, you'll automatically receive the updates. No further action is needed from you after installing this chrome extension. 

This chrome extension is definitely only meant for the die-hard stackies. 
* New tab? Boom. Get a glimpse of the upcoming quests.
* New search? Boom. See that quests you still haven't make a submission.
* Need that quick access to the stackie tool? It'll be just a tab away.

But if you're no longer addicted to stackup anymore, we can still learn from the buildspace os chrome extension, and implement our own custom chrome extension to organise our life better. Have fun!
